"ROCKAGOTCHI" FEATURES:

Create/customize a pet rock with different colors and accessories -- hundreds of unique combinations!

Name your pet and take care of it! If you raise it to adulthood, it'll go off to a college (play to find out which)! But if you let its needs get too low, it'll run away. Keep in mind your pet has needs that are more important to it than others. For example, it can't go out on a walk when it's too tired! It'll be sure to let you know, though, with its face and words! (1. Energy, 2. Hunger, 3. Fun, play different combinations of moods to see what each option may elicit)

Press "v" for vacation!!! You can take your rock on a vacation of your choosing... and you'll get a little souvenir photo from the trip on your desktop! And just like a parent would do, no matter its mood when you take it on vacation, you'll make it smile big for the picture!

The game is pre-loaded with many names for your pet and foods you can feed it. Be sure to keep playing to see all the different options!
